# Polymorphism = Greek word that means to "have many forms or faces"
# Poly = Many, Morphe = Form
# TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM
# 1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
# 2. "Duck typing" = Object must have necessary attributes/methods


# "Duck typing" = Another way to achieve polymorphism besides Inheritance
# Object must have the minimum necessary attributes/methods
# "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."
